Like Jim Rohn said: 
	"Make sure you get the Information. You don´t have to like it."
	
## Today I learned:
### The HTML Boilerplate:
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
		<head>
			<title>title of website</title>
			<meta charset="utf-8"> 
		</head>
		<body>
			<main>
				<section>
				    <!--it's a container for a topic.-->
				</section>
			</main>
		</body>
