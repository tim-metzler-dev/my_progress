  Like Jim Rohn said: 
		"Learn to work harder on yourself than on your job"
	
## Today I learned:
	1. Div vs. section? You use the section for a logical part of the website and the div for the container-layout.
	2. You use the **id** element for a specific element on the site. It can't contain a space.
	3. You use the **class** element to name the elements and style them later.
	4. **Script** is for linking the JS and writing a bit of it in the website. We put it at the very bottom.
	5. HTML enteties are codes you youse to write down html elements in a text like h1 or p.
	6. You use the **button** to make a button.
