# Day3
Like Jim Rohn said: 
	"You can't get more time, but you can get more value."

## Today I learned:
	1. The ul tag. Ist for an underordned list. 
	2. The li tag. These are the elements of the ul list.
		a. <ul>
			i. <li>this is part of list</li>
	3. The figure tag. It is like a frame for an object with an explanation:
	4. The figcaption tag. It's the description of the second object in figure.
	5. The em an strong tag. The em tag makes the text cursive and the strong bold. You have to place between the words you want to change.


ul;li;figure;figcaption;em;strong
