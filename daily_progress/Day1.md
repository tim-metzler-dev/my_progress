# Day 1
Like Zig Ziglar said: 
	"You don’t have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great."

## Today I learned:
	  1.The basic HTML Structure <…> . . . </…>
	  2.Paragraphs <p>…</p>
	  3.Headlines <h>…</h>
		   The biggest headline is h1 and the smallest is h6
	  4.Images <img  src="link_to_the_picture" alt="alternive_description">
	  5.Anchor element <a href="link of website" target="_blank">Go to Website… </a>
		  target="_blank" because we want that the person that is using our site still has accsess to our website.
	
## The Laws of UX:
### Aesthetic-Usability Effect
		Users often perceive aesthetically pleasing design as design that’s more usable.
